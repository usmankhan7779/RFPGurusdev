Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that will meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our service, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout RFPGurus. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular RFPGurus service or feature. Under some circumstances, we may require some additional financial information, such as, but not limited to, credit card information. We use your financial information, including credit card information, to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our products and services. We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Site, Mobile Apps and our other technology platforms. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. We use cookies on our Web site to check your preferences and to maintain session information, including identification of users and preparation of customized Web Pages. Web Browsers set aside a small amount of space on your hard drive to keep these preferences, and then every time you visit a Web site your browser checks to see if you have any predefined preferences (cookies) for that server. If you do, it sends the cookie to the server along with the request for a web page. Your browser will not give up its cookie data to any server except the one that set it. If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, such as: a billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date and tracking information from checks or money orders. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>     
            <p><strong>3. Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br />

                    We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g. couriers, mail, and bill collection) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the personal information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced by RFPGurus Website, Service, Mobile Apps and all other Platforms, Products and Services operated and provided by RFPGurus LLC related operation.                  </p>
